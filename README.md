# Link2Payment

Get your Stripe payment link to get paid everywhere, in emails, on a non-SSL website, donation, from an ebook, on a book (by just displaying the payment link, ...).

Psst! It now works also with PayPal! Get easier your PayPal Payment Link than generating a PayPal button through the old and painful PayPal website.

**Link2Payment** is based on the same code (little bit improved though) than another startup idea called "[MyNewDream.eu](https://github.com/pH-7/MyDreamLife.eu)"

The project is based on a homemade lightweight PHP framework (ideal for very small web apps). Feel free to use it if you like it :smiley:
