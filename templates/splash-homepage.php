        Not having "<abbr title="SSL certificate">https</abbr>" on your website won't be a problem anymore! You don't even need a website anymore! Just put your Stripe (or PayPal) link on your mobile app, in your emails, on forums, on your FB page, Instagram post, or even on your paper book!<br />
        <small>You will be notified by email each time someone buys the item from your link.</small>

        <span class="bold">"One Account" = "One Stripe Link Form" (to share anywhere with anyone)</span><br />
        <span class="small">You will need more accounts (with other valid email addresses) if you need more stripe links.</span>
    </p>

        Psst! It now works also with PayPal! Get easier your PayPal Payment Link than generating a PayPal button through the old and painful PayPal website.
